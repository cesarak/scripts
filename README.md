# ðŸ“° Quick description

Added here are some scripts I use in my projects to automate tasks ðŸš€

## Scripts

### 1) generate_readme [(link)](generate_readme.sh)

Auto-generate README files with project environment variables. You can choose between `Node JS` or `React Native` projects.
Run it using `curl`

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarak/scripts/refs/heads/main/generate_readme.sh)"
```

The script will ask you to customize your README file by adding (or not) some project information
