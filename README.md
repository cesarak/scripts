# ðŸ“° Quick description

Added here some scripts I use in React Native projects to automate tasks ðŸš€

## Scripts

1. Auto-generate README files with project environment variables [(project link)](generate_readme.sh)
   Run it using `curl`

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarak/scripts/refs/heads/main/generate_readme.sh)"
```

The script will ask you to customize your README file by adding (or not) some project information
