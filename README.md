# 📰 Quick description

Added here some scripts I use in React Native projects to automate tasks 🚀

### ✴️ Auto-generate README files with project environment variables [link](generate_readme.sh)

Run it using `curl`
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarak/scripts/refs/heads/main/generate_readme.sh)"
```

The script will ask you to customize your README file by adding (or not) some project informations
